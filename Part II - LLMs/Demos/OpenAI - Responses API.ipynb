EVs must be charged \\nregularly, and charging PHEVs regularly minimizes the \\namount of gasoline they consume. Whether publicly \\navailable or installed in your home, there are vari-\\nous types of charging infrastructure. One important \\nvariation is how quickly they can charge a vehicle. This \\nsection describes the EVSE options so you can choose \\nwhat’s best for you.\\n\\nCharging Your Vehicle\\n\\nInlet\\n\\nConnector\\n\\nUtility 240-V AC\\n\\nCord\\nEV\\n\\nCoupler\\nEVSE\\n\\nControl Device\\n\\nBattery\\n\\nCharger\\n\\nFigure 1.

EV \\n\\nProject publication, www.theevproject.com/documents.php. \\n\\nIllustration by Dean Armstrong, NREL\\n\\nTypes of Charging Equipment \\n\\nEVSE is the equipment used to deliver electrical energy \\nfrom an electricity source (such as the electricity run-\\nning to your home’s outlets) to a PEV. EVSE commu-\\nnicates with the PEV to ensure that it supplies an \\nappropriate and safe flow of electricity. \\n\\nEVSE for PEVs is classified into several categories by \\nthe maximum amount of power provided to the battery. \\nTwo types—Level 1 and Level 2—provide alternating \\ncurrent (AC) electricity to the vehicle, with the vehicle’s \\nonboard equipment converting AC to the direct current \\n(DC) needed to charge the batteries. The other type—\\nDC fast charging—provides DC electricity directly to \\nthe vehicle. Charging times range from less than 30 \\nminutes to 20 hours or more based on the type of EVSE, \\nas well as the type of battery, how depleted it is, and its \\nenergy capacity. \\n\\nEVs typically have more battery capacity than PHEVs, \\nso charging a fully depleted EV takes longer than charg-\\ning a fully depleted PHEV.\\n\\nLevel 1\\n\\nLevel 1 EVSE provides charging through a 120 volt (V) \\nAC plug and requires a dedicated branch circuit per \\nthe National Electrical Code (NEC). Most, if not all, \\nPEVs will come with a portable Level 1 EVSE cord-\\nset, which does not require installation of additional \\ncharging equipment. Typically, on one end of the cord \\nis a standard, three-prong household plug (NEMA 5-15 \\nconnector). On the other end is a standard SAE J1772 \\nconnector (see Connectors and Plugs section below), \\nwhich plugs into the vehicle. \\n\\nLevel 1 works well for charging at home, work, or when \\nonly a 120 V outlet available. Based on the battery type \\nand vehicle, Level 1 charging adds about 2 to 5 miles of \\nrange to a vehicle per hour of charging time.\\n\\nLevel 2\\n\\nLevel 2 EVSE offers charging through a 240 V (typical \\nin residential applications) or 208 V (typical in commer-\\ncial applications) AC plug. This requires installing \\ncharging equipment and a dedicated electrical circuit  \\nof 20 to 100 amperes (amps) (Figure 1).\"\n",

This method was used for EVs in the 1990s and is \\nbecom ing available again with newer EVs as an aftermar-\\nket add-on. SAE International is working on a wireless \\ncharging standard (SAE J2954, standards.sae.org/wip/\\nj2954) that will provide guidance on specifications for \\ninductive charging equipment. Currently, several wireless \\nchargers are available or under development for use with \\nthe Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Volt, and Cadillac ELR.\\n\\nConnectors and Plugs \\n\\nMost modern chargers and vehicles have a standard \\ncon nector and receptacle (Figure 2) known as the “SAE \\nJ1772.” Any vehicle with this plug receptacle can use any \\nLevel 1 or Level 2 EVSE. All major vehicle and charg-\\ning system manufacturers support this standard, which \\nshould eliminate drivers’ concerns about whether their \\nvehicles are compatible with available infrastructure. \\n\\nTo receive DC fast charging, some currently available \\nPEVs (like the Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi i-MiEV) use \\nthe CHAdeMO connector, developed in coordination \\nwith Tokyo Electric Power Company. However, not all \\nvehicles are available with the CHAdeMO receptacle, \\nand it is an option on some vehicles. SAE International \\nhas also finalized a “combo connector” standard for \\nfast charging that adds high-voltage DC power con-\\ntact pins to the SAE J1772 connector. This connec-\\ntor enables use of the same receptacle for all levels of \\ncharging, and is available in some models. The Chevro-\\nlet Spark EV, for example, is compatible with the SAE \\nJ1772 combo connector. Lastly, Tesla’s Supercharger \\nEVSE provides DC fast charging specifically for Tesla \\nEVs.\"\n",

All major vehicle and charg-\\ning system manufacturers support this standard, which \\nshould eliminate drivers’ concerns about whether their \\nvehicles are compatible with available infrastructure. \\n\\nTo receive DC fast charging, some currently available \\nPEVs (like the Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi i-MiEV) use \\nthe CHAdeMO connector, developed in coordination \\nwith Tokyo Electric Power Company.

The Chevro-\\nlet Spark EV, for example, is compatible with the SAE \\nJ1772 combo connector. Lastly, Tesla’s Supercharger \\nEVSE provides DC fast charging specifically for Tesla \\nEVs.

As you can see from this BMW i3 charge \\nmap, the speed at which charge can be accepted drops quickly \\nafter the battery pack reaches 80% capacity. As most cars charge \\nat the same fast rate up to 80%, this is used as an unofficial \\n‘industry standard’ to measure the time taken to rapid charge. \\n\\nUnderstand why car makers quote \\ncharge rates ‘up to 80 percent’\"\n",

This is known as \\n‘selfish’, rather than ICEd.  \\n\\n7. Rapid Charging \\nThere are various ways you can get power into your electric car’s \\nbattery, ranging from Trickle Charging using a common-or-garden \\nthree-pin socket, up to Rapid Charging, which requires some very \\nexpensive kit and is usually found at service stations or some other \\npublic charging points. These are usually comparatively expensive \\nto use (but still cheaper than petrol) so are commonly reserved for \\ntopping up the range when on a long journey. \\n\\nRapid charging works by supplying the power in a way the battery \\nlikes (Direct Current) rather than the car’s on-board inverter having \\nto convert it from Alternating Current, which comes out of a mains \\nelectric supply from the power station. As a result of bypassing the \\ninverter, a top up to 80% capacity usually takes 20-40 minutes.\\n\\n8. Regenerative braking\\nIn a petrol car, you’re burning fuel to move forward. When you want \\nto stop moving you press the brakes and pads squeeze against \\ndiscs to slow the car down. It creates heat and wears away the \\nbrake parts. In an electric car, as soon as you lift off the accelerator \\npedal the motor automatically reverses itself to become a \\ngenerator and starts harnessing the energy to top up the battery. \\nThis is called regenerative braking.\\n\\nIn many modern electric cars you can tailor the amount of regen \\nbraking to suit your driving style and preference. In a Nissan LEAF \\nwith an E-Pedal for example, you can drive without having to touch \\nthe brakes at all, except for an emergency stop. \\n\\n9. WLTP Range \\nThis is the official figure which should give you an indication of how \\nfar an electric car will travel between charges. In theory it should \\nbe an accurate indicator of the sort of mileage you’ll be able to get, \\nbut in reality there are so many different factors which influence \\nthe range that you won’t really know until you try it yourself. City \\ndriving is better for electric cars, whereas motorways, hills, cold \\nweather and driving enthusiastically all eat up power.  \\n\\nThe WLTP part stands for ‘Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles \\nTest Procedure’ and was introduced after a few car makers \\nwere found to be ‘creatively’ finding ways of getting better fuel \\nconsumption and emissions figures in official tests.  The law makers \\ndecided to introduce a tougher assessment which is closer to \\nreal world conditions. As a rule of thumb, we’d knock about 20% \\noff these figures to give you a good idea of the distance you can \\ncomfortably cover.\\n\\n10. kW and kWh \\nA kilowatt is a unit of electricity which is used in all sorts of \\nmeasurements for electric car owners; from battery size and \\nenergy efficiency to charging speeds and energy costs. A kilowatt \\n(or 1,000 watts) is roughly the amount of power needed to run a \\nsmall electric heater. So, if you switched on that heater for an hour, \\nyou’d use 1kWh of energy.\"\n",

If elec-\\ntricity costs 12.3 cents per kWh,3 charging an EV with \\na 100-mile range (assuming a fully depleted 20 kWh \\nbattery) will cost about $2.46 to reach a full charge. \\nThis cost is about the same as operating an average cen-\\ntral air conditioner for five-and-a-half hours.

This stability makes PEVs an \\nattractive option. \\n\\nCharging in Public\\n\\nPublic charging stations make PEVs even more conve-\\nnient. They increase the useful range of EVs and reduce \\n\\nthe amount of gasoline consumed by PHEVs. With \\nmore than 10,000 EVSE locations covering almost every \\nstate, station availability is increasing rapidly. Pub-\\nlicly and privately funded projects are accelerating the \\ndeployment of public stations; for more information, \\nvisit the AFDC’s Deployment of Hybrid and Plug-In \\nElectric Vehicles webpage (afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/ \\nelectric_deployment.html).

Direct emissions are emitted \\nthrough the tailpipe, through evaporation from the fuel \\nsystem, and during the fueling process. Direct emis-\\nsions include smog-forming pollutants, such as nitrogen \\noxides, other pollutants harmful to human health, and \\ngreenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily carbon dioxide. \\nWhen driven in all-electric mode, PEVs produce zero \\ndirect emissions—a great pollution reduction benefit for \\nurban areas. PHEVs do produce evaporative emissions \\nand, when running on gasoline, tailpipe emissions. \\nHowever, because their gasoline or diesel operation is \\nmore efficient than comparable conventional vehicles, \\nthey yield direct emissions benefits even when relying  \\non gasoline.\\n\\nLife cycle emissions include all emissions related to fuel \\nand vehicle production, processing, distribution, use, \\nand recycling/disposal. For example, for a conventional \\ngasoline vehicle, emissions are produced at each stage: \\nextracting petroleum from the ground, refining it to \\ngasoline, distributing the fuel to stations, and burning \\nit in vehicles. Similarly, emissions are produced when \\nextracting raw materials for the production of vehicles; \\nmanufacturing, distributing, maintaining, and operat-\\n\\nfor electricity during off-peak times, you may be able to \\nreduce your electricity costs even further.

Most conveniently, \\nyour home can become a personal electric charging \\nstation, capable of recharging a PEV every night (see \\nthe Charging Your PEV section). In addition, a growing \\nnetwork of public PEV charging stations enables you \\nto top off your PEV’s batteries in a few hours while you \\nwork or shop. Many workplaces have started installing \\ncharging equipment as an employee benefit. The U.S. \\nDepartment of Energy’s Workplace Charging Challenge \\n(energy.gov/eere/vehicles/vehicle-technologies-office-ev-\\neverywhere-workplace-charging-challenge) is designed to \\nencourage employers to consider installing workplace \\ncharging for their employees.

Public fast-charging \\nstations are becoming more widely available, which can \\nboost a properly equipped PEV’s battery in less than 30 \\nminutes.

EVSE commu-\\nnicates with the PEV to ensure that it supplies an \\nappropriate and safe flow of electricity. \\n\\nEVSE for PEVs is classified into several categories by \\nthe maximum amount of power provided to the battery. \\nTwo types—Level 1 and Level 2—provide alternating \\ncurrent (AC) electricity to the vehicle, with the vehicle’s \\nonboard equipment converting AC to the direct current \\n(DC) needed to charge the batteries. The other type—\\nDC fast charging—provides DC electricity directly to \\nthe vehicle. Charging times range from less than 30 \\nminutes to 20 hours or more based on the type of EVSE, \\nas well as the type of battery, how depleted it is, and its \\nenergy capacity. \\n\\nEVs typically have more battery capacity than PHEVs, \\nso charging a fully depleted EV takes longer than charg-\\ning a fully depleted PHEV.\\n\\nLevel 1\\n\\nLevel 1 EVSE provides charging through a 120 volt (V) \\nAC plug and requires a dedicated branch circuit per \\nthe National Electrical Code (NEC).
